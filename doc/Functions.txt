We create posts. We select categories for a post, which can be used for navigation. We create tags for a post. We save a post as a draft or publish it - if the latter, we select a publishing date.

We set blog settings for presentation of dates and times, appearance and blog settings [What does that include?]. We set RSS settings for blogs.

We set comment settings for moderation, notifications, and spam control.

A customer can view a list of posts for a blog. A customer can read a post and create comments. We may or may not vet comments (as per comment moderation settings).
